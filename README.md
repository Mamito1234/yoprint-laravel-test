# YoPrint Laravel Coding Assignment (Developed by Me)

This project was developed as part of a Laravel coding test for YoPrint.  
It is a CSV upload system that processes files in the background using Laravel Queues and displays real-time upload status.

Everything below (except for the Laravel framework) was **fully built and customized by me**.

---

## âœ… Features I Developed

- **File Upload System** with drag-and-drop and manual upload support
- **Real-time UI updates** (polling every 3 seconds)
- CSV file parsing with:
  - Non-UTF-8 character cleanup
  - Idempotent re-uploads
  - UPSERT logic via `UNIQUE_KEY`
- Background processing via **Redis Queues**
- Horizon integrated for monitoring jobs
- Custom database schema with `uploads` and `products` tables
- Clean and responsive UI with sortable columns and file preview
- Laravel Blade templates, no JS frameworks used

---

## Tech Stack

- Laravel 12
- Redis for queue handling
- SQLite database
- Laravel Horizon
- League\CSV for CSV parsing

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
